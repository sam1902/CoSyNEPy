## Things to do:
- ~~Code the Rosenbrock function to evaluate and then test the full code.~~
- Add support for multithreading
- Make the evaluation method editable from the outside.
- Long term : implement OpenAI's Gym to evaluate the network on real problems.
- Long term : Add support for biases in the NeuralNetwork implementation.
